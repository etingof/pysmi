* add more tests on edge cases
* generate reverse OID -> MIB index
* handle SMIv1 MAX clause in range constraint
* support MAX clause mapping it into type-specific value
* handle SMIv1 MIB Table INDEX clause
* report MIB line number on parse errors
* possibly add additional AST processing phase to resolve imported symbols
  in a more consistent way
* add comments (when, where, who) into generated code
* symlink generated MIB files to canonical MIB module name to make it available
  for importing even if original filename is wrong
* are uppercase-identifiers valid in enumeration?
* make codegen surviving IMPORT-less MIBs
* support SMIv1 and common broken SMI constructs in form of SMI parser
  that inherits from base SMIv2 parser
